      <hr>
      <h3 class="me"><p> My name is Alex Brazda and I am a freshman in highschool. I consider myself an outgoing person with a loving personality. Some of my interests include basketball, tennis, and swimming. I play tennis competitevely, while the other two are just hobbies of mine. To be honest, I don't have a plan yet for my future, but as of right now I would consider going into the medical field like my father. I enjoy spending time with my friends, but to me it is equally as important to spend time with my family. I am a unique person, and as a result I try to to stay true to myself as much as possible.</h3></p>
